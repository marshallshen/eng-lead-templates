# Statement of Alliance - [source](http://www.theallianceframework.com/uploads/7/8/2/9/7829688/the_alliance_-_sample_statement_of_alliance_.pdf)

This statement of alliance provides a model for you to use when you’re defining a Transformational tour of duty with an employee. Customize the policies and programs (such as the budget for networking) to reflect the specific circumstances of the company and the team you lead. The statement of alliance should also be personalized with individual goals for the individual employee, but for the sake of fairness, the same general policies and principles should apply equally to all the members of the team.

“I” = the manager
“We” = manager and employee
“We the company” = the company

In a larger organization, the senior management and HR leadership of the firm should work to customize the alliance based on the company’s needs, but should still allow individual managers the leeway to adapt the alliance to their teams.

### Preamble

- I’m glad to have you on my team.
- I view our relationship as a mutual alliance that needs to help both of us.
- This statement of alliance lets us lay out both our expectations so that we can invest in the relationship and each other with confidence.
- I want you to help transform the company.
- In return, I and the company need to help you improve your market value and transform your career (preferably within this organization).
- While I am not making a commitment to offer lifetime employment, and you are not making a commitment to stay for your entire career, we will act to maintain a long-term alliance, even if the employment relationship ends.

## Article 1: Your Tour of Duty

### Principles

- Your tour of duty defines what you will do for me and the business; it also defines what the business and I will do for your career
- While there is no legal obligation on you, me, or the company, and plans can always change, right now we all committed to completing this tour of duty on the basis of mutual trust. This means that if we’re progressing towards our mutual goals, the company won’t fire you, and you won’t leave.
- As we deepen our mutual investment and commitment, we may someday decide to make a long-term, foundational commitment to each other.

### Expectations

- We the company expect this current tour of duty to encompass the time it takes for you to execute the following mission objective: ___________
- I expect this tour of duty will last approximately the following amount of time: ________
- Here is what the results of a successful tour of duty look like for the company (product launches, process improvements, sales, etc.): _________
- As we approach the end of this tour of duty (approximately 12 months to go), you and I should discuss what you would like to do once the tour of duty is complete, either by defining a new tour of duty at the company or discussing your transition to a different company.

## Article 2: Alignment

### Principles

- You, I, and the company all have core aspirations and values.
- We will all work together to align as many aspirations and values as we can between the three parties involved, while understanding there will not be 100 percent overlap.

### Expectations

- I will lay out my core aspirations and values and what I believe are the company’s specific and rigorous core aspirations and values.
- We welcome your feedback and suggestions on those core aspirations and values.
- I would like to learn about your core aspirations and values, even where they differ from mine or those of the company. They are: _________
- We will work together to set mutual expectations for your career trajectory
- We will recognize you for both your business accomplishments and your ability to exemplify the company’s aspirations and values
- If gaps exist, we will address them explicitly and proactively, rather than ignoring them and letting them grow and damage our alliance.

## Article 3: Network Intelligence

### Principles

- Your professional network is a valuable asset, both for you and your career, and for me and the company
- People, including those outside our company, are a critical source of information and insight for solving business challenges.
- The company and I will give you time to build and groom your network; in exchange, we ask that you use your network to help us achieve your mission objective and make the business successful.

### Expectations

- I will be clear about what constitutes nonpublic, nonsecret information you can share with your network.
- While this shouldn’t need to be explicit, you should feel free to use company equipment (e.g., your computer or smartphone) and company time for professional social networking so that you are discoverable and active on social media like LinkedIn and Twitter)
- You may expense any event, conference, or club membership up to X dollars, provided you think it will help you build your professional network. For larger amounts, ask me first, and I will try to approve as many of your requests as I can. You are responsible for sharing what you learn with me and your colleagues.
- You may use company facilities to host external groups and events.

## Article 4: The Alumni Network

### Principles

- Lifetime employment is over for most of us. But a valuable relationship should be lifetime.
- If and when you leave the company, if you’re in good standing, we will invite you to our corporate alumni network.
- The alliance between the company and you as an alum will remain consistent with the same principles: mutual trust, mutual investment, mutual benefit.
- As a current employee, feel free to tap the alumni network for help on solving current business challenges.

### Expectations

- The company and I commit to keeping you in the loop and up to date on what’s happening with the company, including consulting projects or new positions that might interest you.
- When the company or I think there’s a way for you to help us, we ask that you give us a fair hearing, though of course you can decline
- The company will set up tools (e.g. mailing lists, groups, enterprise social networks) to help you tap the knowledge of our employees and corporate alumni.
